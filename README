This repository is for various 6502-related assembly programs.

I'm going to be following Ben Eater's You Tube video series, with initially
one of his kits as the basis of my hardware, and then adding to it as I learn more..

My intention is to learn enough 6502 hardware and software to be able to 
build and program a small 6502 computer for a variety of tasks... projects will 
spring to mind once I delve deeper.

I've included tools needed - the VASM assembler and the MINIPRO eeprom programmer
in this repository, just so I can find them again if I need to.
