I've switched over to using CA65 as my assembler.

All code updates will now be done in the CA65SRC directory. 

I tend to spin off a new project directory once I've added enough changes
in the "current" project, leaving the old one behind as a fallback. 

Eventually I should start managing things properly.....?
